       1. Table tennis has a British origin.
       <br>In as much the table tennis’ origin is still murky, historians link it to Victorian England. During the early ages, Great Britain was much interested in lawn events such as tennis. Later, they brought the sport indoors in the name of table tennis.
        <br><br>
        2. The sport has had three eras:
        <br>
        The first era is called the hard bat era, and that was from the 1920s to the 1950s. In this era, rubber rackets with pimples were used. In addition, the tables were often repainted, and the net was 6.75 inches high. These unfriendly features slowed down the game, and hence, it once took more than an hour to decide a single point at the world championship in Prague in 1936. This led ITTF to decrease the net’s size to 6 inches in 1938, and in the same period, the finger-spin service that was popular among the USA players was banned.
        <br><br>
        The next era was the sponge bat era; in this period, a wooden racket coated with thick foam sponge rubber was invented.
        <br><br>
        And the last one is the speed glue and tennis technology era. Using bicycles’ tires repair glue proved to be an important aspect of the game. It dramatically increased the paddle’s spin and speed. The invention was done by Tibor of Klampar of Hungary and Dragutin Surbek of Yugoslavia, and it was called speed glue. Fast forward, the innovation has been revitalized in many ways, and it has been adopted in all table tennis events.
        <br><br>
       4. The first paddle was the back of a cigar box, and the first net was a stack of books. Surprisingly, the first ball was a champagne cork.
       <br><br>
       5. The sport is the third largest sport in terms of participation after soccer and cricket.
       <br><br>
       6. According to the Olympic world library, over 10 million players participate in various table tennis tournaments each year.
       <br><br>
       7. The longest table tennis point was played for 2 hours and 12 minutes, and it happened in the hard bat era.
       <br><br>
       8. The Guinness Book of World’s Record longest rally holder is Peter Ives and his son Daniel from England. Their rally took 32,000 total hits. The father and son who played for an incredible 8 hours, 40 minutes and 5 seconds, didn’t even stop for a bathroom break. 
       <br><br>

       <br><br>

       <br><br>
       10. China leads when it comes to the number of table tennis players. It has 100 million table tennis players. That is why, at the moment, Asia is considered as the leading sphere for the sports’ popularity.
       <br><br>
       11. The world’s recognized body for the sport is known as the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF), and it was created in 1926. The body has 226 member countries.
       <br><br>
       12. The sport initiated the US and China peacemaking deal during the cold war. In 1971, when the cold war between China and the US was at a peak, the sport was used to bridge the two countries’ frozen relationship. Two sportsmen from the two countries were so kind to each other, and instead of treating each other with the expected suspicion, the players exchanged gifts. That led to Chinese Mao to invite the US table tennis team to China, and he paid all the expenses of the trip. A series of exhibition ping-pong matches were held under the slogan “Friendship First and Competition Second.” Hence, the United States and China were able to heal after so many years of unrelenting conflict. 
       <br><br>
       13.  China is the most dominant force when it comes to table tennis. Sweden and South Korea has also produced plenty of world class table tennis players. 
       <br><br>

       <br><br>
       15.  From 1930 to 1950, the Soviet Union banned the sport because the authorities related it to various eye conditions. But after 1950, the ban was rebuffed.
       <br><br>
       16.b From 2015, the table tennis ball is made from plastic instead of celluloid, and the colors of the ball are either orange or white, along with a matte finish. The table’s color determines the choice of the ball.
       <br><br>
       17. At elite levels, the table tennis match lasts for 30 minutes. Professional players can smash the ball at a speed that exceeds 160 km per hour.
       <br><br>

       <br><br>
       19. It takes serious practice to be considered a potential Olympic medalist or a world-class player; that’s 10,000 hours (21 hours/week for at least ten years).
       <br><br>
       20. There are various table tennis racket coverings (rubber); the number is estimated to be at around 1600. Each rubber comes along with unique characteristics that suit different styles of play. The choice of the rubber affects the speed and the spin that can be imparted on the ball.
       <br><br>
       21. The ITTF must approve the ball for any elite level tournament. The organization prints the ball; this means that it meets the required standards for any official competitions.
       <br><br>
       22.  In 2008, the sport launched team events. Team events mean a one-sided team that comprises both men and women.
