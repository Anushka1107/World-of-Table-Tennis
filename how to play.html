            <h2>2. Know the Table Tennis Grip</h2>  
            <br><br>
            The most fundamental learning on “how to play table tennis” for a beginner, is the proper table tennis grip. A proper grip helps you fix the angle of your racket. You have control over the placement of the ball.
            <br><br>         
            In table tennis, there are mainly two types of grips. One is Shakehand grip and the other one is Penhold grip.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Shakehand Grip</h4>
            <br>
            As the name suggests, in Shakehand grip, try to hold the bat in a way that you are shaking hands.
            <br>
            <img src="shakehand-grip-in-table-tennis.jpg">
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>As in the figure above, hold the upper part of the handle with the middle finger, ring finger, and pinkie.</li>
                <li>Place your index finger on the edge of the rubber ( As shown in the figure above).</li>
                <li>Your thumb should be either on the blade just below the rubber or on the surface of the rubber.</li>
                <li>When the thumb is on the blade, you have more freedom over the racket angle and you can adjust it as per your requirement on the stroke selection. This is the shallow Shakehand grip that is suitable for forehand stroke with more power and flexibility.</li>
                <li>But when the thumb is on the rubber, it is a deep Shakehand grip that gives more control and power over your backhand strokes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Penhold Grip</h4>
            This type of grip is more popular in Asian countries mainly in China, Japan, and South Korea. It is much like you are holding a pen.
            <br><br>
            <img src="penhold-grip-table-tennis.jpg">
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>You have to curl the index finger and thumb around the edge of the paddle to form a ‘c’ shape and relax on one side of the rubber.</li>
                <li>The other three fingers act as support on the other side of the rubber. When they are curled to rest on the rubber, it is the Chinese Penhold grip and when the fingers are straight, it is the Japanese Penhold grip.</li>
            </ul>
            Each type of grip has certain advantages and disadvantages against the other that you will find in <a href="https://tabletennisarena.com/table-tennis-grips/"> this article</a>
            <h2>3. Develop Stance and Ready Position</h2>
            <br><br>
            Before the ball is in play, you have to ready with your stance.
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Stand close to the table</li>
                <li>Your legs should be slightly apart from your shoulders.</li>
                <li>Bent your knees to make your center of gravity low for a good balance.</li>
                <li>Forward your shoulders slightly with the racket in front of your body.</li>
                <li>Your weight should be on your toes, not on the heels.</li>
                <li>Point your free arm to support your balance.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            Take your stance with your left foot slightly forward than the right foot (for the right-handers). As you will cover more strokes on the forehand side, this stance will give you more advantage.
            <br><br>
            The ready position is the position where you feel comfortable standing to cover the playing area. It is the position where you take your stance to receive the service.
            <br><br>
            After playing a shot during a rally, you should return to your ready position. From this position, you should watch your opponent’s movement and be able to move in any direction for the next stroke.
            <br><br>
            Take your stance slightly left from the center of the table as it is easy to cover the area on your forehand side. For a left-hander, the stance is slightly right from the center of the table.
